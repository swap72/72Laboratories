## 🧘 Platform Usage Strategy

Knowing **how to use** these platforms mindfully is **key**.  

> **Start filtering from low-rated problems** and gradually **push your limits**.

🔑 Learn to extract maximum value:
- For example, **LeetCode** offers:
  - Curated **Blind 75**
  - **Must-Do 150** problem set
  - Topic-wise filters for focused practice

---

## ⚠️ Very Important: Mindful Practice

> “Quality > Quantity”

- Revisit **solved problems**
- Re-solve using:
  - A fresh new approach  
  - An old approach with added constraints  
  - A more efficient method  

This **cultivates deeper understanding** and decodes **problem-solving patterns**.  
Don’t solve blindly — solve **mindfully**. That's where real growth happens.

Happy Coding 🚀  
Push your limits, one problem at a time.
