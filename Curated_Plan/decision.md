# 📚 Must-Learn (Specific Order)

- C  
- Python  
- JavaScript  
- SQL  

> **Believe me or not, but do not jump onto learning anything "cool" before learning these languages mentioned above.**

## 💡 Opinion-Based Languages (What I Personally Think)

### 🟠 Java :
To strengthen OOP concepts, pick **Java**. It has more job listings, much larger community support, and a very matured ecosystem.

### 🟣 C# :
**C#** is very strong in the Microsoft ecosystem, now open-source as well — meaning it’s being used outside the Microsoft ecosystem too. Similar to Java, but with better features, especially **LINQ**, which is better than a bunch of chained stream methods and stuff.

The only reason why **Java** is ahead of **C#** is because C#'s open-sourcing happened much later, primarily after 2014 under Microsoft — leaving Java far ahead in the open-source adoption race. This also explains why there are more jobs in **Java** than in **C#**.

Otherwise, in terms of features, I personally believe that **C#** is a more feature-rich language than **Java**.
But that being said, you can not write off the fact that C# is indeed born out of [Java's language design philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPlumnuhTco&t=499s).

- **C++** is one of my favorite and the most powerful **systems programming languages** after **C** and **Rust**.
- Start learning **Go** if you’re into **cloud technologies** and **developer operations**.
- As a hobby, I’m currently learning **Rust** and squeezing out some time to read about the **Zig programming language** for **embedded systems**.


#### And Why Limit yourself??
- Wanting more is nothing bad, you can always be a master of 4-5 languages, tools and frameworks.

## ✅ DOs :

Learn **C**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **SQL** very well — then move on to either **Java** or **C#** for a strong backend language option in API development.  

Choose based on the in-demand, trending frameworks in the job market:  
- If **Spring Boot** is rising in demand, learning **Java** is a wise choice.  
- If the firm and salary are good, going with **C#** is also a great option.

If solely interested in **systems programming** and **WebAssembly**, blindly go with **Rust** and **C++**.

For **programming embedded systems**, as of today there are no better options than **C/C++**, **Rust**, and **Zig**.

For **AI/ML** and **Data Science** — **Python** is obvious.

## 🔥 The Never-Ending, Controversial Language Debate (My Opinion)

Just because you think you are perfect in that high-paying `xyz` language, doesn’t mean that your `xyz` programming language is perfect. Things evolve, change, and improve.

### 📖 Why This Programming Language Debate Doesn't Make Any Sense To Me (My Analogy)

> Consider yourself surviving in a jungle.  
> You have only two tools/weapons: a **sword** and a **dagger**.  
> Now, a swordsman is so skilled with his sword, he thinks he can survive in a jungle only with his sword.  
> **Sometimes, confidence turns into arrogance in no time, and moves you away from reality.**  
> 
> On the other hand, a **wise man** takes both — because he knows that a sword cannot do the job of a dagger, and vice versa.

> **He, who respects and understands time, bows down to the need of the hour.**

Every language is **powerful in its own use case**.

If an `xyz` language has high-paying jobs — but if you’re a low-level kinda guy (microcontrollers and stuff..) like me — you’d choose **passion over money**.  
(⚠️I am not into programming microcontrollers and chips(this is big brain stuff..), I Just enjoy coding in system-level language)

Or say you enjoy **writing code** in that particular language or love its features more than any other high-paying languages — then you should pick and choose **what makes you happier**, because **satisfaction is priceless**.

## ✅ Conclusion : *Having a [toolbox](https://swap72.github.io/72Laboratories/Curated_Plan/architectisartist) is alwyas better than having a single tool*
