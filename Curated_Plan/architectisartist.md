_Earlier I used to think, the real nerds are the ones who have sharp coding skills, like leetcode and CP stuff.._

_My understanding grew, then I realized that the real nerds are the one who's domain specific knowledge is good and have mastered a particular language tool or technology_

_I realized, I was wrong, the real nerds are the ones who have very good thinking in terms of design, in the world of computer science the design is everything, if you can think in terms of secure, scalable, stable and modular design, this is greater than any other skill, able to think of a modern, complicated and secure design which solves real world problem is an art in itself._

_And now I realize I was wrong again, everything matters, every thing we have been learning matters, everything we have been learning has somehow subconsciously contributed to what we are able to build today..._
