# Must-Learn (Specific Order)

- C  
- Python  
- JavaScript  
- SQL  

> Believe me or not but do not jump onto learning anything "cool" before learning these languages mentioned above

---

## Opinion based languages (what I personally think)

### Java :
To Strengthen OOP concepts pick Java, also java has more job listings, and a much larger community support and a very matured ecosystem.

### C# : 
C# is very strong in the Microsoft Ecosystem, now open-source as well, meaning it is now being used outside the Microsoft ecosystem as well, similar to java but with better features, specially LINQ, which is better than a bunch of chained stream methods and stuff..

Only reason why java is ahead than C# is because C#'s open-sourcing happened much later, primarily after 2014, under Microsoft. Leaving java much ahead in the open-source adoption race.. this also explains why there are more jobs in Java than in C#

Otherwise in the terms of features, I personally believe that C# is more feature rich language than Java.

C++ one of my favorite and the most powerful Systems programing language after C and Rust

Start learning Go language if you are into the cloud technologies and developer operations

As a hobby I am currently learning Rust and squeezing out some time to read zig programming language for embedded systems 

---

## Conclusion :

learn C, python, JavaScript and SQL very well, then move onto either Java or C# for a strong backend language option in the API development, you can choose and pick based on the in-demand trending framework in the job market example if Spring Boot framework is rising in demand then learning java is a wise choice, but if the firm and salary is good going with the C# is also a good option.

if solely interested in Systems programming and WebAssembly blindly go with Rust and C++

for programming embedded systems as of today there are no better options other than C/C++, Rust and Zig.
